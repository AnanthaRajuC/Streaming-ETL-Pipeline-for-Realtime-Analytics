# Real-Time Streaming ETL Pipeline / Streaming Analytics: Real-Time Data Insights

![streaming_etl](documentation/images/streaming_etl.png)

In this project we will create a simple streaming data pipeline to continuously capture the changes in a MySQL database and replicate them in near real-time into ClickHouse.
